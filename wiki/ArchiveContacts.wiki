#summary Contact information for various fuuka archivers

= Introduction =

Fuuka is the software used to run various 4chan archivers. Neither me (Eksopl) nor the original author maintains a running archive. If you have an issue with a specific archive, look below for information on how to contact them. Posts and bug requests made here will not be read by the people who *can* do something about your request, so please contact directly the people that run the site you want to reach.

In addition, foolz,us uses fuuka as their archiving daemon, but they run their own software for the website frontend. Please file issues regarding to the software the foolz archive runs [https://github.com/FoOlRulez/FoOlFuuka/issues here]. If it's an issue with the dumper itself, you can report it here.
