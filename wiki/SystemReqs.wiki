#summary Fuuka system requirements

==System requirements== 
  * Recent version of perl (anything >= 5.8.X should be okay, must be compiled with ithreads. Do {{{perl -V | grep ithread}}} to check)
  * MySQL 5+
  * A webserver that can run CGI scripts or Apache with mod_perl (recommended)
  * gnuplot (version >= 4.2, gd with PNG support)
  * Ability to run daemons / background processes (GNU screen recommended)
  * Around 110~250 MiB of RAM per board being archived

 
==Perl modules==
Apart from standard modules that you probably already have (CGI, Carp, Data::Dumper, Encode, Time::HiRes), you'll also need the following perl modules installed:
  * URI::Escape
  * DBI
  * Digest::SHA1
  * LWP
  * DBD::mysql (Important: you need version >= 4.0, otherwise Unicode characters will get messed up in the database. Do {{{perl -MDBD::mysql -e 'print "$DBD::mysql::VERSION\n"'}}} to check)

==FreeBSD ports==
If you're running FreeBSD, just install the following ports:

  * lang/perl5.10 (enable threads)
  * net/p5-URI
  * databases/p5-DBI
  * security/p5-Digest-SHA1
  * www/p5-libwww
  * databases/p5-DBD-mysql
  * math/gnuplot (you can disable all the options in graphics/gd and all the options except for gd in math/gnuplot to avoid building X11)
